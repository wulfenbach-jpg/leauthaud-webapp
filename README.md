# Open Source and DIY Sensing Systems for Water Management

We help growers and urban gardeners to understand and solve problems related to water resources by offering a bucket of innovations and solutions for water management.

## Project Mission
Water management tools and sensing systems are often expensive, proprietary, or difficult to find. This repository serves as a centralized hub for **nonproprietary, open-source, and DIY solutions**. Our goal is to empower individuals and communities with the technical knowledge needed to manage water resources sustainably and efficiently.

## Check out existing solutions!
A number of tools have been developed; however, they are scattered across the web. We have synthesized existing solutions and provided a technical description of each in this repository. 

Key features include:
- **Live Synchronization**: Data is pulled directly from a curated Google Sheet, ensuring the repository is always up-to-date with the latest research.
- **Technical Profiling**: Each entry includes TRL (Technology Readiness Level), scale of use, sensing types, and direct links to source documentation.
- **Search & Filter**: Navigate the catalog by technology type (IoT, AI, Remote Sensing), irrigation method (Drip, Sprinkler, Surface), and developer category.

## Contribute
We are constantly looking to expand this technical catalog. **Let us know if other existing tools exist so we can enrich this document!** 

If you have a solution to share or have found a bug in the documentation, please reach out or submit a suggestion via the linked research channels.
